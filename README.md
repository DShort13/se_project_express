# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

This project involved setting up an Express project, creating a server using API and user authorisation, creating a database by creating schemas and models and connecting it to the server, configuring the first routes and controllers, and handling errors.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature via nodemon
